# Open-Ended Streams

## Abstract

This CEP defines an additive transport profile for open-ended streaming over ContextVM. It reuses MCP `notifications/progress` as the transfer envelope and uses the request `progressToken` as the stream identifier.

Unlike bounded oversized-payload transfer in [`CEP-22`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/cep-22.md), this CEP defines a long-lived stream model where ordered fragments may continue until the sender explicitly closes or aborts the stream. The stream payload itself is the primary incremental output, but it does not replace the final JSON-RPC response for the originating request.

This CEP is intended for cases where data is naturally incremental, long-lived, or unbounded, and where representing the result as one reassembled MCP request or response would be artificial or inefficient.

## Specification

### Overview

ContextVM currently transports MCP JSON-RPC messages through Nostr events. That model fits ordinary request and response exchange well, and [`CEP-22`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/cep-22.md) extends it for bounded reassembly of oversized logical messages.

Some use cases are different in nature:

- long-running generation that emits useful partial output over time
- event feeds or incremental result sets
- progressive delivery where partial consumption is desirable
- cases where no single final rendered payload is the right abstraction

This CEP defines an open-ended stream profile that:

- reuses the existing single-kind ContextVM transport model
- reuses MCP `notifications/progress` as the stream envelope
- uses the request `progressToken` as the stream identifier
- supports ordered `start`, `accept`, `chunk`, `ping`, `pong`, `close`, and `abort` frames
- treats the stream itself as the payload rather than a bounded reassembly artifact
- allows receivers to process fragments incrementally as they arrive

This CEP is intentionally distinct from the bounded reassembly mechanism in [`CEP-22`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/cep-22.md). Implementations MUST NOT treat these two profiles as interchangeable.

### Capability Advertisement and Negotiation

Support for open-ended stream transfer MAY be advertised through the same additive discovery surfaces already used by ContextVM capabilities and transport features, following the patterns in [`CEP-35`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/informational/cep-35.md).

Peers MAY advertise support using one or more `support_open_stream` tags.

Example tags only:

```json
[["support_open_stream"]]
```

Advertisement surfaces:

- **Public announcements:** Servers MAY advertise support in public server announcements.
- **Initialization:** Clients and servers SHOULD advertise support during MCP initialization when initialization is available.
- **Stateless operation:** Clients and servers MAY advertise support in tags on the first exchanged request or response when no prior initialization occurred.

Support semantics:

- `support_open_stream` indicates support for the open-ended stream profile defined by this CEP.

### Request-Level Activation

Open-ended stream transfer for a given logical exchange is available only when the initiating request includes a valid MCP `progressToken`.

Activation rules:

- Clients that want to permit open-ended streaming for a request MUST include a `progressToken`.
- Servers MUST NOT start an open-ended stream for a request that did not include a `progressToken`.
- When no `progressToken` is present, peers MUST use ordinary non-streaming behavior or fail cleanly.

The `progressToken` is the stream identifier for the open-ended stream session.

### Sender Behavior

When open-ended stream transfer is used, the sender MUST emit an ordered sequence of MCP `notifications/progress` messages containing ContextVM stream frames.

If the sender already knows the receiver supports this CEP for the exchange, it MAY proceed directly from `start` to `chunk`. Otherwise it MUST wait for `accept` before sending `chunk` frames.

The sender:

- MAY emit any number of `chunk` frames after stream startup
- MAY keep the stream open while useful incremental output continues
- MUST terminate the stream with either `close` or `abort`
- MUST NOT silently stop transmission without a terminal frame unless transport failure prevents completion

Multiple streams MAY exist concurrently between the same peers, but each active stream MUST use a distinct `progressToken`. A sender MUST NOT send a second `start` for a stream that is already active under the same `progressToken`.

### Progress Notification Framing

Open-ended stream frames are carried inside MCP `notifications/progress` params. The MCP envelope remains valid and additive; ContextVM defines additional frame semantics inside the params object.

Example conceptual envelope:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-123",
    "progress": 1,
    "message": "(Optional) starting open stream",
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "start"
    }
  }
}
```

The sender MUST use `progress` values that increase monotonically across the stream, consistent with MCP progress rules. `progress` orders all stream frames, including control frames, and MUST NOT be interpreted as a chunk counter.

### Frame Types

This CEP defines seven frame types:

- `start`
- `accept`
- `chunk`
- `ping`
- `pong`
- `close`
- `abort`

#### Common Fields

All open-stream frames MUST include a ContextVM-specific transport object with:

- `type`: MUST be `open-stream`
- `frameType`: one of `start`, `accept`, `chunk`, `ping`, `pong`, `close`, `abort`

The outer MCP progress params MUST include:

- `progressToken`
- `progress`

The outer MCP `total` and `message` fields MAY be used for UX hints or progress reporting, but they do not define stream correctness.

#### `start` Frame

The `start` frame begins the stream.

Optional fields:

- application-defined advisory payload metadata

Rules:

- `start` establishes intent to begin an open-ended stream under the given `progressToken`.
- Applications MAY include additional advisory metadata in `cvm` on `start` when both peers understand it.
- Receivers MUST NOT depend on advisory `start` metadata for stream correctness.

#### `accept` Frame

The `accept` frame confirms that the receiver accepts the stream and that the sender may begin transmitting `chunk` frames.

This frame is primarily intended for bootstrap in stateless sender-to-receiver flows where support is not yet known.

Rules:

- A receiver MAY send `accept` after `start`.
- A sender that is required to wait for confirmation MUST NOT send `chunk` frames before receiving `accept`.
- `accept` SHOULD remain minimal and does not negotiate additional stream parameters in v1.

##### When `accept` Is Required

`accept` is conditional bootstrap confirmation, not a universal requirement.

This mirrors the `accept` semantics defined in [`CEP-22`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/cep-22.md), so implementations can reuse the same conceptual model for conditional bootstrap confirmation and avoid semantic drift between the two transfer profiles.

- If the sender already knows that the receiver supports this CEP for the exchange through prior negotiation, explicit capability advertisement, or other valid context for the exchange, it MAY send `chunk` frames immediately after `start`.
- If support is not yet known for the exchange, the sender MUST wait for `accept` before sending the first `chunk` frame.
- In stateless bootstrap flows where no prior support knowledge exists, `accept` is required before the first `chunk`.

#### `chunk` Frame

The `chunk` frame carries one ordered fragment of stream payload.

Required fields:

- `data`: chunk payload fragment
- `chunkIndex`: contiguous chunk index

Rules:

- For open-stream frames, MCP `progress` is the normative stream-ordering field for all frames.
- Each `chunk` frame MUST use a `progress` value greater than the preceding stream frame's `progress` value.
- `chunkIndex` MUST start at `0` for the first `chunk` frame in the stream and increase contiguously by `1` for each subsequent `chunk` frame.
- `data` carries one ordered fragment of the stream payload, following the same chunk-payload semantics as [`CEP-22`](/src/content/docs/spec/ceps/cep-22.md).
- Receivers MUST use `chunkIndex`, not `progress`, to validate chunk contiguity and payload completeness.
- Receivers MAY buffer valid out-of-order `chunk` frames within bounded local limits and process them once the contiguous `chunkIndex` sequence resumes.
- Receivers MAY track missing `chunkIndex` values as provisional gaps while the stream remains active.
- Receivers SHOULD enforce bounded buffering or equivalent local resource policy for unresolved chunk gaps.

#### `ping` Frame

The `ping` frame probes whether the peer remains responsive for the active stream.

Required fields:

- `nonce`

Rules:

- Either peer MAY send `ping` on an active stream.
- `nonce` MUST identify the probe uniquely within the stream.
- Receivers SHOULD enforce a local maximum nonce size of `64 bytes` and MAY reject, ignore, or abort on oversized nonces.
- `ping` carries no stream payload.

#### `pong` Frame

The `pong` frame acknowledges a received `ping` for the active stream.

Required fields:

- `nonce`

Rules:

- A receiver of `ping` MUST respond with `pong` for the same stream unless the stream has already terminated.
- `pong.nonce` MUST match the triggering `ping.nonce`.
- `pong` acknowledges peer responsiveness only and does not acknowledge delivery or processing of stream payload.
- A `pong` with an unknown, duplicate, expired, or already-satisfied `nonce` is invalid for keepalive matching and MUST NOT be treated as evidence of stream liveness.
- Receivers MAY ignore invalid `pong` frames and MAY apply local logging or anti-abuse policy to them.
- Implementations MAY apply local anti-abuse policy to `ping` handling, including ignoring, coalescing, rate-limiting, or aborting on excessive keepalive traffic.

#### `close` Frame

The `close` frame signals successful sender-side closure of the stream.

Optional fields:

- `lastChunkIndex`

Rules:

- `close` is required for successful stream completion.
- `close` indicates that no further `chunk` frames will be sent for the stream.
- When present, `close.lastChunkIndex` MUST equal the greatest `chunkIndex` sent for the stream.
- Senders SHOULD include `close.lastChunkIndex` when they intend `close` to declare a finite chunk-completeness bound for the delivered payload.
- Senders MAY omit `close.lastChunkIndex` for live, event-like, or otherwise open-ended streams where no chunk-completeness bound is being declared.
- If the stream included no `chunk` frames, `close.lastChunkIndex` MUST be omitted.

#### `abort` Frame

The `abort` frame signals that the stream did not complete successfully.

Optional fields:

- `reason`

Rules:

- Either peer MAY send `abort`.
- Receivers MUST treat `abort` as terminal for the stream.
- `reason` is advisory only.
- A peer MAY send `abort` when local policy determines that successful continuation is no longer acceptable or no longer plausible, including resource exhaustion, excessive unresolved gaps, timeout, or anti-abuse conditions.

### Validation Rules

#### Ordering and Lifecycle

Receivers MUST validate stream ordering using MCP `progress`.

To fail a stream means to treat it as unsuccessfully terminated, release local state for it, and NOT treat it as successfully completed. A peer that fails a stream SHOULD send `abort` with an advisory `reason` when it is still able to transmit.

Rules:

- a stream MUST begin with `start`
- if confirmation is required for the stream, `accept` MUST be received before the first `chunk`
- `progress` values for open-stream frames MUST increase monotonically across the stream
- receivers MUST treat `progress` as the canonical frame-ordering field, not as a chunk count
- `chunk` frames MUST include contiguous `chunkIndex` values beginning at `0`
- receivers MAY buffer valid out-of-order `chunk` frames within bounded local limits while awaiting missing earlier `chunkIndex` values
- receivers MAY treat missing `chunkIndex` positions as provisional gaps while the stream remains active
- receivers MUST NOT treat a gap alone as terminal failure while the stream remains active, except under local timeout or resource policy
- `pong` MUST correspond to an earlier `ping` on the same stream
- a second `start` received for an already active `progressToken` MUST cause the stream to fail
- successful completion requires `close`
- if `close.lastChunkIndex` is present, receivers MUST treat it as the completeness bound for the stream payload
- when `close.lastChunkIndex` is present, successful completion requires receipt of every `chunkIndex` from `0` through `lastChunkIndex`
- if gaps remain when `close` is received, receivers MAY wait a bounded local grace period for delayed chunks or MAY fail immediately under local policy
- if `close` arrives after malformed or non-monotonic ordering, the stream MUST fail

This CEP does not define replay, selective retransmission, or repair.

#### Post-Close Behavior

After `close` or `abort`:

- the stream is terminal
- receivers MUST ignore or reject later frames for the same terminated stream
- senders MUST NOT resume the same stream identifier

### Receiver Behavior

Receivers that support this CEP:

- MUST track stream state by `progressToken`
- MUST process frames in stream order
- MUST reject or fail malformed frame sequences
- MUST treat `abort` as terminal
- MUST allow a valid zero-chunk stream in which `close` follows `start` without any `chunk` frames
- MUST fail a stream if `close` is received before `start` or after malformed ordering
- MAY terminate a stream with `abort` when local timeout, buffering, relay-safety, or anti-abuse policy makes continued processing unacceptable

Receivers MAY expose stream fragments to applications incrementally as they arrive.

### Stateless Operation

This CEP is compatible with stateless ContextVM operation.

In stateless operation:

- peers MAY advertise support in tags on the first exchanged request or response
- stream state is correlated by `progressToken`
- receivers MUST NOT rely on a persistent connection-local session beyond temporary stream state

For stateless client-to-server streaming where the client has not previously learned server support, the client MUST send `start` first and wait for `accept` before sending `chunk` frames.

### Request Completion Semantics

Open-ended streaming supplements the lifecycle of the originating JSON-RPC request; it does not replace it.

Rules:

- A stream associated with a request MUST still conclude with exactly one final JSON-RPC response for that request.
- `close` indicates that no more stream frames will be sent, but it does not itself satisfy the JSON-RPC request/response lifecycle.
- After sending `close`, the sender MUST send the final JSON-RPC success response for the originating request.
- If a stream associated with a request is terminated with `abort`, the sender SHOULD send a final JSON-RPC error response when it is still able to do so.
- Implementations MUST NOT synthesize successful final JSON-RPC responses locally solely from receipt of `close`.

### Timeout and Keepalive Semantics

Receipt of any valid open-stream frame counts as stream activity.

Implementations MUST maintain an idle timeout for each active stream.

Rules:

- receipt of `start`, `accept`, `chunk`, `ping`, `pong`, `close`, or `abort` MUST reset the idle timeout
- if no valid frame is received before the idle timeout expires, the peer MUST send `ping`
- the receiver of `ping` MUST respond with `pong` carrying the same `nonce`
- implementations MAY apply local anti-abuse policy to keepalive traffic, including rate-limiting, coalescing, ignoring, or rejecting excessive `ping` traffic and rejecting oversized `nonce` values
- if the probing peer does not receive a matching `pong` before its probe timeout expires, it MUST treat the stream as failed
- a peer that fails the stream due to probe timeout SHOULD send `abort` if it is still able to transmit
- implementations SHOULD enforce a hard maximum timeout or other resource policy for long-lived streams

### Relay Rate and Flow-Control Guidance

Nostr relays may impose different event-rate, buffering, or publication policies.

Implementations:

- MUST NOT assume that all relays accept the same sustained event rate
- SHOULD throttle frame emission conservatively enough to respect expected relay policies
- MAY apply local policy to abort, defer, or deprioritize streams that exceed relay-safety limits
- MUST NOT assume that this CEP provides transport-level backpressure signaling in v1

### Example: Server-to-Client Open Stream

Client sends a request with a `progressToken`:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "streaming_tool",
    "arguments": {},
    "_meta": {
      "progressToken": "req-123"
    }
  }
}
```

Server starts the stream:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-123",
    "progress": 1,
    "message": "starting stream",
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "start"
    }
  }
}
```

Server sends stream fragments:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-123",
    "progress": 2,
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "chunk",
      "chunkIndex": 0,
      "data": "Hello"
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-123",
    "progress": 3,
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "chunk",
      "chunkIndex": 1,
      "data": " world"
    }
  }
}
```

Server closes the stream:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-123",
    "progress": 4,
    "message": "stream complete",
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "close"
    }
  }
}
```

Server returns the final JSON-RPC response for the originating request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Stream completed successfully"
      }
    ],
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

### Example: Stateless Client-to-Server Stream Bootstrap

The following example shows the stream bootstrap phase only. As in [`Request-Level Activation`](#request-level-activation), the initiating JSON-RPC request for this exchange has already been sent and already supplied the `progressToken`.

Client announces intent to begin a stream:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-789",
    "progress": 1,
    "message": "starting client stream",
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "start"
    }
  }
}
```

Server confirms support:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "req-789",
    "progress": 2,
    "message": "client stream accepted",
    "cvm": {
      "type": "open-stream",
      "frameType": "accept"
    }
  }
}
```

After `accept`, the client sends `chunk` frames and eventually terminates the stream with `close` or `abort`. If the stream is associated with a JSON-RPC request, the exchange still concludes with the final JSON-RPC response for that request.

## Backward Compatibility

This CEP introduces no breaking changes:

- peers that do not advertise support continue using ordinary ContextVM request and response transport
- peers that do not include a `progressToken` on a request do not enable open-ended stream transfer for that exchange
- peers that do not understand the ContextVM-specific open-stream framing continue to interoperate for ordinary non-streaming messages
